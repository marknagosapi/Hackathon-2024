# Hackathon-2024

Welcome to the Hackathon-2024 repository! This is where we will collaborate and work on our project for the upcoming 48-hour hackathon.

During this intense and exciting event, we will have the opportunity to showcase our skills, creativity, and teamwork. The hackathon will provide a platform for us to brainstorm ideas, develop innovative solutions, and present our projects to a panel of judges.

Over the course of 48 hours, we will be challenged to think outside the box, solve problems, and build a functional prototype. It's a great opportunity to learn new technologies, collaborate with like-minded individuals, and push our limits.

We are looking forward to this hackathon and are excited to see what we can accomplish together. Let's make the most of this experience and create something amazing!

Happy hacking!:D
